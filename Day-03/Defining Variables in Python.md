### Best Practices while defining the variables in Python:

1. Snake Case (snake_case)
Words are lowercase and separated by underscores (_)

Common in Python (PEP 8 standard)

Examples:

```python
user_name = "akshay"
total_price = 99.99
def get_user_data():
    pass

```




2. Camel Case (camelCase)
First word is lowercase, each next word starts with a capital letter

No spaces or underscores

Examples:

```python
userName = "akshay"
totalPrice = 99.99
def getUserData():
    pass
```
