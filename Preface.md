Started learning python for my DevOps learning trajectory, and without wasting time, I have jumped into the pond. This repo has the sole purpose of keeping track of my learning journey, along with helping others 
to learn the way I understood things. I hope this adds value to your learning too.

I will be following Abhishek Veermalla Sir's YouTube video to go ahead with. Pasting the link for your reference:
